In this second week of the bootcamp, we dug deeper into basic programming structures and object oriented programming. In the second half of the week we assembled teams to create a terminal based Python program that demonstrated our understanding of basic programming structures, object oriented design/programming, and Git/GitHub collaboration. Our team was successful in recreating a parody version of Oregon Trail with features like: Characters, Party, Combat, Events, Merchants/Shops, Locations, Audio/Text Art display.
