- Learned JavaScript
- Learned about the DOM
- Learned about XHL & Fetch calls to retrieve data from APIs
- Learned how to connect HTML to the DOM via JavaScript to make our web pages dynamic

In this fourth week we really started to bring things together with JavaScript and APIs in our websites. We have now learned how to request data from external sources and use that data to populate our HTML. Using these techniques we can make our front end web projects dynamic with any data that we can find through public APIs.
