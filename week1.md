#Week 1

- Learned basic terminal commands in Unix based systems
- Learned basic Git & Github
- Learned basic Python

In our first week (from a Windows perspective) I set up a Linux VM and learned how to navigate WSL2 terminal with basic commands like ls, cd, mv, mkdir, and more. We practiced with Python, learning basic data types and control structures like if, elif, while, ordered data structures like lists, and unordered data structures like dictonaries. Continuously throughout the week we have practiced pushing our work to Git and Github, practicing with initializing Git/Github, merge conflicts, and more.
