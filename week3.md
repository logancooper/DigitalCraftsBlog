In this third week, we've jumped into HTML and CSS. This is not something I'm familiar with so it has been exciting to get a basic understanding of web documents and how to inspect/work with them. I've recreated a few websites, created a codepen.io and created several pens, and started inspecting sites that I use to find out how they created their elements.
